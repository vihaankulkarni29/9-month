                    <h2>The Power of Three Little Words</h2>
                    <p>"Vihaan, I want to tell you something", as we were walking past Jai Hind college, when I thought you were going to say I love you but you didn't. We both looked at each other and smiled and both of us knew what the other felt. I remember being in the rickshaw from Goregaon station where you said, "Vihaan, I love you", which are still the most important words I heard from you and I'll always cherish that. Eating momos after that and we could not stop smiling at all.</p>

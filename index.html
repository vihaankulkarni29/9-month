                         <p>Shaky hands, cold feet and a random photo I sent you with my sunglasses on. To look cool I tried to get money from an ATM even though I knew that I didn't have a PAN card, oh god what I would do to impress you. I still remember ordering that peach iced tea and both of us instantly calling it out as "omg this is so sweet", and I could feel my body shake as I asked you to be my girlfriend. Forever grateful that you said yes to that.</p>

                         <p>"Vihaan, I want to tell you something", as we were walking past Jai Hind college, when I thought you were going to say I love you but you didn't. We both looked at each other and smiled and both of us knew what the other felt. I remember being in the rickshaw from Goregaon station where you said, "Vihaan, I love you", which are still the most important words I heard from you and I'll always cherish that. Eating momos after that and we could not stop smiling at all.</p>

                         <p>I remember this was the first actual time I have felt drunk in my life and I am glad it was with you (we can ignore Fiona). Those Budweisers, my god I still cherish them. Just finishing beer after beer and we both felt just the right amount of buzz and amazing feeling. I know we don't talk about this day enough but I really really enjoyed this day with you.</p>

                         <p>"Hey Vihaan, I heard this Sinners movie is damn good", you know who we're talking about. We can again ignore Aman and still enjoy an amazing 2 hours and 30 mins we spent together watching the most visually amazing movie of the year with a great soundtrack. Whenever I rewatch Sinners, all I can imagine is the spark in both of our eyes as we witnessed a great movie.</p>

                         <p>After so many days of relentlessly stuck in rickshaws, I just thought, I NEED TO JUST USE MY SCOOTY. You were eating the ice cream, oh sorry softie from McDonald's. I had my dumb face on when I picked you up, We went from Oberoi to your building and it was still the best scooty ride that I have had with you. Love you the mostest babili darling.</p>

                         <h3>First Liverpool Match Together</h3>
                         <p>Liverpool vs United (fuck those idiots), still pretty fresh but I know a memory that I will always cherish and love. Kind of a stupid call to go all the way from Goregaon -> Kandivali -> Khar -> Kandivali -> Goregaon, phew that actually took a toll but a toll worth taking. Liverpool lost but as cheesy as it sounds I won in life before :) <3.</p>
